# Myntra_Product_Analysis_PowerBI-Project
I undertook a comprehensive project focused on Myntra's fashion clothing, utilizing a substantial dataset of over 500,000 rows. The journey from data cleaning to crafting insightful visualizations was both demanding and rewarding, offering valuable learning experiences along the way.

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation: The initial phase involved meticulous data cleaning and transformation. Utilizing DAX, I implemented various techniques to address inconsistencies, remove duplicates, and handle missing values. This step was crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): To derive meaningful insights from the dataset, I computed several key performance indicators (KPIs), which included:

Total Number of Products: Understanding the breadth of the inventory.
Average Rating: Evaluating customer satisfaction and product quality.
Average Number of Reviews: Assessing product popularity and consumer engagement.
Average Original Price: Analyzing the pricing strategy.
Average Discount Offered: Understanding promotional strategies.
Average Discounted Price: Identifying the effectiveness of discounting in sales.
3. Insightful Visualizations: To bring the data to life, I created a series of compelling visualizations that provided a comprehensive overview of Myntra's fashion landscape. Key visualizations included:

Number of Brands by Category: Visualizing brand distribution to identify market leaders.
Number of Products by Category: Analyzing product variety across different categories.
Number of Reviews by Category: Highlighting customer feedback patterns.
Average Discount Offered by Category: Understanding pricing strategies within each category.
Category-wise Rating: Assessing customer satisfaction across different fashion segments.
Comparison of Average Original Price and Average Discounted Price by Category: Evaluating the impact of pricing on consumer behavior.
Average Discount by Individual Category: Identifying trends in discounting practices.
4. Actionable Insights: By effectively visualizing complex data, I transformed intricate information into digestible formats. This approach not only made it easier to understand the dynamics of the fashion retail sector but also uncovered actionable insights. These insights can inform strategic decisions, such as:

Optimizing Pricing Strategies: Understanding where discounts have the most significant impact on sales.
Targeting Marketing Campaigns: Identifying categories with high engagement to focus marketing efforts.
Enhancing Inventory Management: Utilizing product variety insights to optimize stock levels.
5. Future Recommendations: Based on the analysis, I recommend implementing regular monitoring of these KPIs to track changes over time. Additionally, leveraging advanced analytics techniques such as predictive modeling could further enhance understanding of consumer behavior and improve strategic decision-making.
